Major features/bugs:
- Make the exact matcher threaded!
- JRuby/Java multi-processor use
- Database timeout issues (autoReconnect=true for MySQL)
- Job management: canceling, etc.
- MySQL spawning in JAR is lame
- Combine multiple matcher scores in scenario runs

Fancy features for the future:
- Do authorization on projects
- Allow user to enter resource password whenever needed; don't store it
- Allow score_sets to be used as resources
