Major features/bugs:
- Job management: canceling, etc.
- Chain matchers
- package:dist changes bundler config; fix this!

Other ideas:
- Do authorization on projects
- Allow user to enter resource password whenever needed; don't store it
- Better migrations based on commit hashes
  - Use classes in a previous state
  - Run migrations before upgrading code, or vice versa
