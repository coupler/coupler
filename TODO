Major features/bugs:
- Add more validations for comparators
- Use select boxes in exact comparator instead of text box
- Make the exact matcher threaded!
- Some transformers aren't appropriate for certain data types

Fancy features for the future:
- Do authorization on projects
- Allow user to enter resource password whenever needed; don't store it
- Allow score_sets to be used as resources
